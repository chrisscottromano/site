								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								
								<p>Leaving aside the question of conceptual acquisition, what determines how an idea is ultimately represented? Inter-subject consistency of word-meaning representation is negatively correlated with concept abstraction (Bi, 2021), suggesting (broadly) that sense drives convergence of meaning while language drives divergence. In theory, a concept with no external referent should have total subjectivity (exists insofar as it is conceived), and a referent represented non-linguistically should have total objectivity (exists insofar as it stimulates sensory receptors). Of course, these examples are akin to ‘frictionless spheres in vacuums’ used by physicists, i.e., they are thought experiments that explain dynamics, and are not known or thought to actually exist. We expect that any concept is subject to both sense perception and linguistic context. Even concepts with no external referent can acquire sensory association, either through their position in semantic vector-space or by their treatment in communication.</p>
								
								<h2>Communication</h2>
								
								<p>Communication, whether expressly or accidentally, serves to integrate word and object. The concrete becomes abstract through interpretation and association, while the abstract becomes concrete through shared reality construction. The motivation to form mutual understanding generally overrules the motivation towards favoring one’s own conceptualization; though the latter provides the grounding force that gives necessary constraint to the phenomenal viewpoint from which shared reality is negotiated.</p>
								 
								<h2>Ideology</h2>
								
								<p>Ideology can be understood as a mechanism of efficiency in the procedure of conceptual codetermination. Rather than work through higher-level concepts one-by-one, a large set of ambiguities can be quickly (albeit uncritically) resolved at once by adopting an ideology, or preconstructed set of defined and associated concept representations. The word ideology is often used pejoratively, generally referring to an unjustified persistence of ideologically derived concept representations. This is when ideology becomes dogmatic — when renegotiation is not accepted. Perhaps this is motivated by an anxious belief that reconceptualization implies that an aspect of one’s ideology is incorrect, which may imply that the ideology as a whole is also incorrect. Self-esteem and cognitive dissonance are powerful reinforcers of concept, especially when a concept is represented as an element of a larger conceptual ‘system’ — as is the case with ideology.</p>
								
								<p>Ideology feels good. Adopting a large set of concept representations resolves a significant amount of ambiguity at once, which produces an impression of insight and/or enlightenment. There is also a shared reality motivation, in that ideology adoption constitutes, at least in sentiment, the joining of an agentic group (agentic insofar as the group has assembled a unique ‘space’ of understanding in which cognitive activity can operate on solid ground, free of the obligation to question presuppositions).</p>
								
								<h2>Absurdity</h2>
								
								<p>In the early destalinization era of post-WWII Poland, citizens of Warsaw lived with an acute awareness of the chasm between the representation of reality put forward and enforced by the soviet-led government and reality itself. In a dangerous subversion of the socialist-realist movement — a standardization of artistic style formalized in legal policy — artists of the era captured this sentiment in their work. (Lem, Mrozek, etc.)</p>
								
								<p>Largely powerless against this representation, the removal of the ‘sharing’ element of shared reality leads to an altered state of consciousness that we may call absurdity. The intuitive flavor of Polish absurdity is evoked in the Theatre of The Absurd, a movement among playwrights in which the basic character of story is forgone, as it no longer represented the lives of the Polish citizenry.</p>
								
								<p>In Adam Curtis' documentary, <i>Hypernormalisation</i>, an interview with a Soviet citizen provides insight into how top-down ideological enforcement destabilizes the individual capacity to represent reality. When asked “Do you believe?”, the citizen responds, “believe who?”. For her, and for many others in her predicament, idea had dissolved into persona. The interviewer further attempted to ascertain what she considered to be ‘true’, to which the citizen replies, “I don’t believe anybody, I don’t believe in anybody, and I don’t believe in you.” Still in terms of person (as opposed to concept), she rebukes the notion of shared reality, and expresses defensiveness surrounding her acquired nihilism.</p>
								
								<h2>Propaganda</h2>
								
								<p>The propagandist’s greatest bastardization of meaning representation may well be the so called “glittering generality” — words that represent abstract ideals, and, void of concrete referent, are subject to multi-modal distribution across clusters of connotative association that, in cases most relevant to the propagandist, organize along social divisions. Properly ‘charged’, these words act counterintuitively when communicated, becoming further ensconced in increasingly local representative and associative linkage within a semantic neighborhood. </p>
