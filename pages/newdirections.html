										<p>Above are two spectrograms (visual representations of audio over time).<br> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. “Let it be - Original” is a spectrogram of The Beatles’ song “Let it be”. It was created by directly analyzing an audio file. <br> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. “Let it be - Recovered” is a spectrogram of the reconstructed audio signature of the room. It includes both ambient noise and the song “Let it be'“, which was playing on a speaker in the room. <br> <br>

Despite the messiness introduced by ambient noise, the key features of the song are clearly visible in both spectrograms. This feature-visibility corresponds to the ability of applications like Shazam to recognize the song. In other words, Lamphone’s reconstructions of room audio from visual recordings are quite accurate.</p><br>
																	<h3>How does it work?</h3>
																	<p>A quick primer is warranted. Understanding the following makes understanding Lamphone very easy.</p>
																	<p>In 1948, mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude E. Shannon </a> published <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf"> "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"</a>.</p>
																	<blockquote>This paper established the field of Information Theory and coined the term ‘bit’ to refer to the most basic unit of information. Every form of digital communication owes its existence to Shannon’s paper. Shannon is also responsible for digital circuit design theory. Thus, both the hardware and software of modern computers can be traced to Claude Shannon.
																	</blockquote>
																	<p>Shannon outlined the basic elements of communication with the following diagram:

									<p>Communication entails sending information to a receiver. However, information is an idea and has no form of its own – it must be represented in a way that can be interpreted by the recipient.</p>
									<p>For example, here are the steps of this process in verbal communication:
</p>
									<ol>
													<li>Information is encoded in a message.
															<ul>
															<li>A person represents what they mean with words
															</li>
															<ul>
															<li>meaning=information, words=message
															</li>
															</ul>
															</ul>
													 </li>
														<li>A transmitter must then send that message in the form of a signal.
															<ul>
															<li>A person uses their vocal tract to create vibrations in the air
															</li>
															<ul>
															<li>vocal tract=transmitter, air vibrations=signal
															</li>
															</ul>
															</ul>
													 </li>
													<li>Between sender and receiver, noise is introduced, creating signal interference.
															<ul>
															<li>Vibrations travel through the air, which contains other vibrations
															</li>
															<ul>
															<li>other vibrations=noise
															</li>
															</ul>
															</ul>
													 </li>
										<li>The signal is received and presented as a message to the receiver.

															<ul>

															<li>Vibrations hit the cochlea and cause a neural response in the auditory cortex that the brain’s language network recognizes as words
															</li>
															<ul>
															<li>vibrations=signal, words=message
															</li>
															</ul>
															</ul>
													 </li>
										<li>The message is decoded back into information.

															<ul>

															<li>The words are mapped to what the receiver believes them to mean
															</li>
															<ul>
															<li>words=message, meaning=information
															</li>
															</ul>
															</ul>
													 </li>
													

												</ol>

								<p>All forms of communication follow these steps. Just the same, any process that follows these steps <i>is</i> communication.
								</p>
								<p>Eavesdropping is the act of covertly hijacking the signal during step 3. A classic technique is using a concealed microphone to capture air vibrations, later playing the recording back as noise with a speaker. Recording is possible because sound exerts a physical effect on the microphone’s diaphragm, allowing the microphone to represent the vibration pattern as data. Speakers do exactly the opposite, turning data into vibration patterns with the same rules of transformation.
								</p>
								<p>Imagine a powerful camera filming a room. A sound in the room disturbs the air, which disturbs the light bulb, which disturbs the distribution of light in the room. Since the camera is so powerful, the changes in light distribution are captured in the video. In theory, these changes can be translated back into the original sound if we are able to mathematically account for the signal’s journey (sound→air→bulb→light) and use the same formulas to reverse through the steps (sound←air←bulb←light).
								</p>
								<p>This is exactly what Lamphone does.
								</p>
								
								<h2>
								Lamphone's Strategy</h2>
								<p>The recording captures interference in light caused by sound waves hitting the bulb. Frame by frame, an algorithm visually examines minuscule changes in light distribution and reverse-engineers the audio signature of the sound causing those changes.

						<p>The physics are relatively straightforward. The recording is done with an electro-optical sensor (a specialized type of camera), which detects changes in light and maps them numerically. Sound waves hitting a lightbulb create disturbances in the light that can be picked up by these sensors.

							On the above diagram, electro-optical sensors can measure the quantity of light at any given coordinate. Measuring these quantities over time allows vibrations of the light bulb to be observed via their effect on light distribution.
</p>
							<p>After conducting experiments to determine how different sounds affect a bulb’s field of light, the authors were able to write an algorithm that could ‘speak the language’ of light interference, translating bulb vibrations into high-fidelity audio in real time.
							
							</p>
							<p>
							This technique works on any room with a lightbulb and an unobstructed window. It can be beaten by turning off the light, or by using a low-watt bulb (no light = no interference pattern for an algorithm to decode). This method also thwarts a similar tool that rebuilds audio from footage of potato chip bags, which are also vibrated by sound waves.

							</p>
							<p>However, you remain vulnerable to the laser microphone — a device that projects a laser, captures its reflection, and analyzes the interference added by sound along the way.

						<p>The trade-off is that, with the right tools, the laser can be detected while Lamphone cannot. The only way to know you are being recorded by Lamphone is to look out the window at the person on the street aiming a telescope at your window.

						<p>This is the current state of declassified eavesdropping technology in a nutshell. If you are ever worried that you may be spied on, keep in mind the sensitivity of modern machine learning algorithms. Information embeds itself into the environment, and a clever engineer can extract that information from the most unexpected sources.
