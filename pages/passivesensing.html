								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								
								<p>Behavioral Medicine is a division of Preventive Medicine in which healthcare providers attempt to optimize their clients' long-term health outcomes by analyzing health-relevant behavioral patterns and intervening on behaviors that constitute a risk-factor. For example, a provider may ascertain that a client with obesity is continuing to gain weight due to poor nutrition and frequent nighttime eating. Since obesity is a cardiovascular risk-factor, the provider may prescribe a set of dietary goals (including both nutritional content and meal-timing) and — thanks to developments in Mobile Health (mHealth) — may also provide tools that the client can use to increase their success in meeting their goals. Typically, the provided tool would be a food-logging mobile or computer application that ostensibly increases the self-monitoring capabilities of the client. Such tools, while useful, are only the beginning. Advances in sensor technology, time-series processing algorithms, and commercial electronic manufacturing have opened the door for consumer products that have clinical use and are capable of collecting high-level behavioral data passively; that is, without the user having to tell the device what they are doing.</p>
								
								<h2>Wearables</h2>
								
								<p>Wearable devices are generally the ideal host for a sensor system. A popular example is the implementation of pedometers, pulse counters, and even ECG sensors in commercial smartwatches (e.g., Apple Watch). Smartwatches have come to dominate commercial sensor technology due to the relative simplicity of enabling passive sensing on smartwatches (as opposed to other types of devices). Smartwatches (1) spend all-day with the user, (2) are worn in a position that allows robust access to biometric features, (3) typically feature bluetooth, wifi, and/or cellular connectivity, and (4) are a highly 'acceptable' host for health-sensing technology. </p>
								 
						
								
								<p>Let's consider each point one-by-one. <br> 1 — "spend all day with the user"<br> Smartwatches are comfortable and non-intrusive enough that they are often worn during all waking hours. This advantage is shared by clothing, which is difficult to enable with sensors without altering the clothing item such that it becomes user-unacceptable; and by smartphones, which do not have an on-body positioning conducive to biometric data collection. <br>2 — "worn in a position that allows robust access to biometric features"<br> Smartwatches are worn on the wrist, a body-location that provides several opportunities for biometric sensing. Inertial motion-sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) can collect data from which physical activity (i.e., exercise) can be inferred and from which certain behaviors can be recognized. Photoplethsmographic sensors (PPG) are able to collect blood oxygen saturation signals from which pulse and heart-rate-variability can be inferred. Electrocardiographic sensors (ECG) are able to interpret localized electrical activity such that an ECG signal can be obtained. Galvanic Skin Response sensors (GSR) transmit elecric currents through skin tissue, the resistance of which can be used to infer skin conductance; a proxy for emotional state.</p>
								
								<p>While the wrist is somewhat limited in its provision of biometric information, the widespread acceptability of wrist-worn devices (as well as the minimal structural changes necessary to house sensors inside smartwatches) makes wrist-based sensing extremely practical in comparison to other body regions. </p>
								
								<h2>Absurdity</h2>
								
								<p>In the early destalinization era of post-WWII Poland, citizens of Warsaw lived with an acute awareness of the chasm between the representation of reality put forward and enforced by the soviet-led government and reality itself. In a dangerous subversion of the socialist-realist movement — a standardization of artistic style formalized in legal policy — artists of the era captured this sentiment in their work. (Lem, Mrozek, etc.)</p>
								
								<p>Largely powerless against this representation, the removal of the ‘sharing’ element of shared reality leads to an altered state of consciousness that we may call absurdity. The intuitive flavor of Polish absurdity is evoked in the Theatre of The Absurd, a movement among playwrights in which the basic character of story is forgone, as it no longer represented the lives of the Polish citizenry.</p>
								
								<p>In Adam Curtis' documentary, <i>Hypernormalisation</i>, an interview with a Soviet citizen provides insight into how top-down ideological enforcement destabilizes the individual capacity to represent reality. When asked “Do you believe?”, the citizen responds, “believe who?”. For her, and for many others in her predicament, idea had dissolved into persona. The interviewer further attempted to ascertain what she considered to be ‘true’, to which the citizen replies, “I don’t believe anybody, I don’t believe in anybody, and I don’t believe in you.” Still in terms of person (as opposed to concept), she rebukes the notion of shared reality, and expresses defensiveness surrounding her acquired nihilism.</p>
								
								<h2>Propaganda</h2>
								
								<p>The propagandist’s greatest bastardization of meaning representation may well be the so called “glittering generality” — words that represent abstract ideals, and, void of concrete referent, are subject to multi-modal distribution across clusters of connotative association that, in cases most relevant to the propagandist, organize along social divisions. Properly ‘charged’, these words act counterintuitively when communicated, becoming further ensconced in increasingly local representative and associative linkage within a semantic neighborhood. </p>
