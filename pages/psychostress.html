								<h2>A Ubiquitous Mystery</h2>
								
								<p>"What is stress?"</p>
								
								
								<p>Hilariously, this remains an open question among scientists. A lot has been learned about stress, but thus far science has failed to provide a unified conception of what stress it is. </p>
								 
								<h2>Some Good Ideas</h2>
								
								<p>A promising model of stress asserts that, while stress is more or less a single physical state, there are two types of induction (physical, psychological) that cause it; each possessing their own ramifications.</p>
								
								<p>Ideology feels good. Adopting a large set of concept representations resolves a significant amount of ambiguity at once, which produces an impression of insight and/or enlightenment. There is also a shared reality motivation, in that ideology adoption constitutes, at least in sentiment, the joining of an agentic group (agentic insofar as the group has assembled a unique ‘space’ of understanding in which cognitive activity can operate on solid ground, free of the obligation to question presuppositions).</p>
								
								<h2>Absurdity</h2>
								
								<p>In the early destalinization era of post-WWII Poland, citizens of Warsaw lived with an acute awareness of the chasm between the representation of reality put forward and enforced by the soviet-led government and reality itself. In a dangerous subversion of the socialist-realist movement — a standardization of artistic style formalized in legal policy — artists of the era captured this sentiment in their work. (Lem, Mrozek, etc.)</p>
								
								<p>Largely powerless against this representation, the removal of the ‘sharing’ element of shared reality leads to an altered state of consciousness that we may call absurdity. The intuitive flavor of Polish absurdity is evoked in the Theatre of The Absurd, a movement among playwrights in which the basic character of story is forgone, as it no longer represented the lives of the Polish citizenry.</p>
								
								<p>In Adam Curtis' documentary, <i>Hypernormalisation</i>, an interview with a Soviet citizen provides insight into how top-down ideological enforcement destabilizes the individual capacity to represent reality. When asked “Do you believe?”, the citizen responds, “believe who?”. For her, and for many others in her predicament, idea had dissolved into persona. The interviewer further attempted to ascertain what she considered to be ‘true’, to which the citizen replies, “I don’t believe anybody, I don’t believe in anybody, and I don’t believe in you.” Still in terms of person (as opposed to concept), she rebukes the notion of shared reality, and expresses defensiveness surrounding her acquired nihilism.</p>
								
								<h2>Propaganda</h2>
								
								<p>The propagandist’s greatest bastardization of meaning representation may well be the so called “glittering generality” — words that represent abstract ideals, and, void of concrete referent, are subject to multi-modal distribution across clusters of connotative association that, in cases most relevant to the propagandist, organize along social divisions. Properly ‘charged’, these words act counterintuitively when communicated, becoming further ensconced in increasingly local representative and associative linkage within a semantic neighborhood. </p>
